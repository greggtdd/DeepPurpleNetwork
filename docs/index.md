## About The Project

<div style="text-align: justify">My name is Gregorio Tedde and I'm a Data Science graduate based in Sardinia, Italy. After my first degree in Economics, I started my specialization studies on Big Data and since then I've been coding in <em>Python</em>, <em>R</em> and <em>Spark</em> languages in order to deal with machine learning projects, text mining and network analysis every day. I've always been a computer enthusiast since I was a kid, and before growing up with my coding skills, I was already working as a digital graphic designer and as a synthesizer programmer. The latter job is related to another one of my life's passions, which is Music and it actually turned to be a current occupation too. I started taking piano lessons at the age of nine years old, but the real turning point was when my dad gave me a special book as a present for my eleventh birthday. This gift was actually an Italian <b>Deep Purple</b> biography published in 1986, just two years after the successful <em>Mk II</em> reunion. Since then, Jon Lord became my biggest music hero and I began playing organ and keyboards in many local bands across Sardinia, while writing and recording my own songs. I've also started collecting Purple's stuff and everything else related to their family tree. Each record, book or magazine that had the "<em>Deep Purple</em>", "<em>Whitesnake</em>", "<em>Rainbow</em>" tag or other purple-associated names on their cover had become an integral part of my listening and reading routines in the little free time. Off course, my interest in exploring the various relations between all the members that took part in Deep Purple's history and other famous associated acts still grows on me, and this is the reason why I've started wondering: "<em>What if Big Data and Rock Music could deal together?</em>".</div>
