# Deep Purple Universe

## Deep Purple Line-ups

### Members for each Line-up

<div style="text-align: justify">Let's start with some basic "purple notions". The stack bar-plot below shows which member of Deep Purple has been in a specific line-up, from the earliest Mark I to the current Mark VIII.  All the graphs in this page are interactive, so you can select which member you want to obscure from the legend.</div>

### From Mark I to Mark VIII

<div style="text-align: justify">This other plot is based on the classic Mark I - Mark VIII timeline you can find on all the best well-known Deep Purple fan-sites. The members' names on the left side can be selected, as in the previous graph, in order to customize the visualization. Each line-up is also marked with the years in which they have been active.</div>

### Rare Line-ups

<div style="text-align: justify">Over the years, several musicians shared the stage together with Deep Purple on the occasion of some special events, tour legs, or just for dealing with unforeseen circumstances affecting some members of the band. For example, many US tours in the Seventies have seen members of the band dealing with hepatitis, so proper substitutes were called to jump on stage if the shows couldn't be postponed or canceled. Other formations reported here are based on studio auditions, such has the one for the recording of <em>The Battle Rages On album</em> in 1992.</div>

## Most influential artists in the Deep Purple family

### Eigenvector Centrality

<div style="text-align: justify">In Graph Teory, the importance of a single node can be described by measuring its centrality inside the network. Many algorithms can be executed for this purpose, and, amongst these, Eigenvector Centrality can be described as the dominant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors" target="_blank">eigenvector</a> of the adjacency matrix used for building the graph itself. In order to quantify a node's influence, all centrality scores are assigned to the other nodes, by taking into account the connections between the high-scoring vertices. These connections contribute more to the score of a specific node than equal connections to low-scoring ones. A high eigenvector centrality means that a node is connected to many nodes, who themselves have some high scores. Hence, the number and importance of neighbors can be used to quantify each node's influence. Here are the 25 most influencial artists from the original Deep Purple network.</div>

### Artists' PageRank scores

<div style="text-align: justify"><a href="https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/algorithms/" target="_blank">Google's PageRank</a> is a variant of Eigenvector Centrality, and it measures the global influence of a specific node, by including its indirect influences. This algorithm has been used not only to detect artists who are significant in their own way, but also those who interact with more influential musicians. PageRank scores are expressed as percentages (a logarithmic scale is used by Google). For example, Joe Lynn Turner (0,96% score and 56 links) has a higher PageRank than Screaming Lord Sutch (0,95% score and 63 links), even though there are fewer links to the latter one. This happens because the fewer links to Joe Lynn Turner come from more relevant artists than the ones to which Screaming Lord Sutch is connected, and those connections are considered of higher value in this context.</div>

### Bands' PageRank scores

<div style="text-align: justify">The same criterion described above can be also applied for the bands. Festival events play, off course, a major role in this ranking, but also bands such as <b>Whitesnake</b>, <b>Blackmore's Night</b> and the <b>Michael Schenker Group</b> seem to be relevant given their numoerous line-ups, which include some of the most influential musicians from the original network. </div>
